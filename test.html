        <p><h2>Now I've heard you need some help making choices? How unfortunate, there's no help for you, at all. What this means is that there is no equation or set of rules that lets you live your life. There is no higher authority that you can appeal to. The universe is indifferent to your actions and everything you do. But that's what's so nice, isn't it? You can do absolutely whatever you want. <b> You're Free!</b> But that's what's also what so horrible isn't it? Who knows the horrible things you could do or be? That's why, your choices making up WHO you are. You are constantly redefining yourself by how you live life and there is nothing that can prevent you from acting in a way. So, be yourself. :)<h2> </p>
