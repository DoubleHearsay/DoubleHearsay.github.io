         <li>The kid who never talks in class? He could have been constantly shut down for his opinions.</li>
         <li>The one who keeps on talking? He may have always been under attack abd required to constantly assert his authority.</li>
         <li>The girl that gets offended at every joke you make? Perhaps she was the victim of horrific badgering and slandering.</li>
         <li>The person that sleeps in class? Possibly never recieved encouragement as a child.</li>
         <li>The valedictorian of her class? She might have recieved life-cutting kinds of austerity at home.</li>

      <p>You know, sometimes some people can seem utterly disgusting, don't they? People can often get on our worst sides so unreasonabley, so irrationally.
      There has to be something wrong with them.
        
      </p>
       <p>Perhaps there is, but it might not be their fault. What we learn in our childhood really does follow us into adulthood. 
       We somehow view adults as different versions of children, free of their past. But it's much more different than that.
       	</p>
       <p><h3>What I'm talking about is <b>my</b> concept of the <i>Tabula Rasa</i>(sortof). <p>People don't have THINGS programmed into them. But at the same time, it's not easy to erase something once it's been placed there.
       </p>
       <p>We're all really crazy on the inside. And it's ok. None of us are perfect. We may annoy each other; we may frustrate each other.
       But we don't mean it. So let's all help each other get through this.</p>
