       <p><ul>
         <li>Humans have freedom.</li>
         <li>Humans also have ambitions and talents.</li>
         <li>However, they are told to be guilty of their powerful stregnths.</li>
         <li>Humans also have weaknesses..</li>
         <li>However, they are told to accept that and be content.</li>
         <li>Noble power is no longer valued in society as people constantly join the bandwagon.</li>
         <li>The world is divided into good and evil to be easy to judge.</li>
         <li>People don't face reality.</li>
         <li>Humans go through a metamorphesis.</li>
         <li>They are first a camel to withstand the ideas of the world.</li>
         <li>They then must become a lion to fight off the old ideas.</li>
         <li>They are then a child to recreate their own world.</li>
       </ul></p>
      <p>It may be controversial, but it works nonetheless. Humans don't explore their true ambition and power because they are told that
      power is bad by society; they are then held back</p>
       <p>The important thing is, you do not have to obey any preordained life. It is up to you to choose your own purpose and escape the bandwagon.
       	</p>
       <p><h3>What I'm talking about is <b>my</b> concept of the <i>Will to Power</i>. 
       Individuals must go beyond good and evil to take on the whole of life. That is living like a superperson, or an Ubermensch.
       They realize that they are built up by the good things AND the bad things that happen to them.</h3></p>
