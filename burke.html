        </h4></p></h3></p><br>
       <p><ul>
         <li>You work everyday.</li>
         <li>Then, on one business trip one day, you get trapped in a storm!</li>
         <li>The storm makes you feel weak and insignificant.</li>
         <li>After getting through it, you feel different.</li>
         <li>You then go on a vacation to the Grand Canyon.</li>
         <li>Such a glorious view makes you tremble before it.</li>
         
       </ul></p>
      <p>In short, when you go through life, you feel like every singel moment is important. Any mistake will destroy the world.</p>
       <p>However, when you are met with an incredible and uncromprehendable force. You realize not everything you do can destroy the world. It makes you feel small, but at the same time, in comfort.
       	</p>
       <p>In fact, that was the purpose I found in going to church every Sunday. It related people with an unstoppable
       force that made them feel small, but at the same time, comforted. They looked at the big picture and what was really important.</p>
