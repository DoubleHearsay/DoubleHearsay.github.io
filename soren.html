       <p><ul>
         <li>Say you're a professional sprinter.</li>
         <li>You run everyday, training more and more.</li>
         <li>You're known by all your friends as "the runner".</li>
         <li>The one fateful day, you're at the groccery store.</li>
         <li>You push the cart but realize the whole shelf is falling over and crushes your legs!</li>
         <li>With no bionic legs, you can never run again. Who are you?</li>
         
       </ul></p>
      <p>Now we don't expect random rampaging shelves to ruin our lives, but stuff can happen.</p>
       <p>But the thing is, the sadness that takes you over...was with you the whole time!
       	</p>
       	<p>Even when you had your legs intact, you still had this great sadness, this sorrow, within you.
       <p><h3>What I'm talking about is <i>The Sickness Unto Death</i>(DESPAIR!!). 
       Let me elaborate, what you did in this situation is that you <b>destroyed</b> your identity when you replaced it with this concept of runner. Bob was lost, and runner took over.
       Even if you do get boinic legs, you'll still have that sorrow. Your identity is still lost. What you have to do is...find yourself.
       Realize that everything you have can be lost, and find out what have now. That is who you are. Your acheivements, economic standing, and friends cannot help you.
       The only thing you have is your character: your personality, morals, etc.
