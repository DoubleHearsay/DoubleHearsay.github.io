This website is for all but at the same time a website for none. It has no daily use. It is more of a doctor that prescribes you with a philosopher in times of need. It is something to refer to when social rules, logic, and science turn out very wrong. You turn here when you have an existential or any life crisis. It is an example of emotional technology.
